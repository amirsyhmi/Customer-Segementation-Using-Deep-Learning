# Customer-Segementation-Using-Deep-Learning
Develop deep learning model using TensorFlow keras

## Objective
To develop a classifier model by using TensorFlow keras to identity the group of customer.
- Model Training: `Deep Learning`
- Method: `Squential`
- Module: `Tensorflow`

The dataset that used in this analysis can be obtain from [[Customer Segmentation
Multiclass Classification]](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2)

## About the Dataset:
There datasets that used in this analysis
- customer_segmentation.csv(8067 entries data with 11 columns)

Our target is on the 11th columns, which name as `Segmentation`. The dataset will be used to develop the deeplearnng model.

## Results
